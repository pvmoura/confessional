If it can't detect a category in the current question, use an old category
Why are there so many intro questions?
If there's a hardfollow, but the same category is firing and the person has talked for awhile, maybe just default to the category
Also, in the case of a hardfollow, remember categories from previous questions
Silence detector should only start after question stops playing

Booth statements:
Booth1 - anytime
Booth2 - anytime after 10 minutes
Booth3 - anytime after 15 minutes

Use a booth statement between transitions, especially if it is a random transition

Endings 

1. booth1, booth2 and booth3 – Max wants to hear the whole corpus on site tomorrow, so we should have these working
2. incorporating DANCEMOVES1c_T01.aif – i've put it in the database. it's a whole song though, so i dunno if want we want is the ability to fade out the music and then skip to the next question – this may fall under manual controls – or just go for the simple option, have it fade out after a little while. i defer.
3. manual controls
4. memory ("earlier you were talking about...")
5. documentation at end (post-interview bookkeeping)
6. keywords – the luxury item. if this doesn't happen until next week, it's okay – we can incorporate it into the two later shoots.
